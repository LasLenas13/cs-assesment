The extraLargeArray is passed into doublerAppend, it takes 2.015833 ms to double every number, where doublerInsert takes 703.363042 ms. This shows that the doublerAppend is faster than the doublerInsert for an array of this size. The pattern continues until you get to the smallArray and TinyArray, where then Insert becomes quicker than Append (26 micro vs 139 micro). In terms of scaling, Append is the faster/better function as the numbers increase. This is due to the push method that adds elements to the end of the array. Where as Insert, uses the unshift method to add elements to the beginning of the new array, which requires shifting all the existing elements down taking more time.
